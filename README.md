Most of this work was done on Sunday mornings with [Nina](Nina.png).

## Installation
Run the file [Nina.msi](https://github.com/franpossetto/Nina/releases/tag/v1.2) provided in this repository.

## Overview

A collection of tiny tools to work faster in Revit.
Most of these commands are availables in Revit but as options in second windows. As they are actions that the users repeats very often, the goal is to be able to access them quickly, using keyboard shorcuts.

## Recommentation
For correct use, use these commands as keyboard shorcuts. This is my personal configuration:

|Panel| Tool | Shortcut  | 
|-----|-----|-----|
|Type Selector|`Type-up`| `tt`|
|Type Selector|`Type-down`| `yy`|
|Type Selector|`View Range (+)`| `qq`|
|Type Selector|`View Range (-)`| `ww`|
|Type Selector|`WallType by Dimension`| `dd`|
|Point Clouds|`Show Hide Point Clouds`| `hp`|
|Point Clouds|`Color Mode: Set Normals`| `nn`|
|Links|`Show Hide RVT Links`| `hk`|
|Links|`Show Hide RVT Links`| `hc`|
